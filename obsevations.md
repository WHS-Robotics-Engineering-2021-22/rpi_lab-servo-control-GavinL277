In what various ways does the servo behave differently than a DC motor?
What makes the use of a servo more complex (remember that if you were controlling a DC motor with a Pi, you would need to write some code)?
What applications do you thin servos are appropriate for? Explain.

Because with this one you have a form of being able to control it.
The servo is much more complex becuase of the coding process. With a dc you have one motion but with the servo you have to account for multiple.
You can use servo's for many things. For example conner had made it so that it was similar to how a sprinkler functions.
